This is my first attempt at using React Native.

My goal is to build an app which allows people to find out where cats are in their local neighbourhoods.

I would like to learn how to use React Native, how to add a map to my app, allow users to upload pictures and automatially remove listings once 5 people have said that the cat is no longer there.

You can see the app that I have designed on <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/duzOGrfoiSsGIulGedmpnj/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1">Figma</a>.
